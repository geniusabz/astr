                    <p>Each carsharing operator has its own procedure for returning cars from an impoundment lot. Most often, two options are offered:</p><ul><li>the operator picks up the impounded carsharing car on its own. In this case, the person who used the carsharing last, pays a fine for parking, impoundment, storage of the car at the impoundment lot and a fine that the operator can assign;</li><li>the driver who left the car in the wrong place, picks it up from the impoundment lot on their own. In this case, they only pay for towing, a fine for parking and, if necessary, the storage of cars in a impoundment lot.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If the car was not impounded in your presence, you will be contacted (by phone, SMS, email or in the app) by representatives of the carsharing company and will tell you what options you have. If you yourself noticed that the carsharing car was towed, call the operator; thus, you will avoid overpayment for long-term storage of the car in the impoundment lot.</p>
