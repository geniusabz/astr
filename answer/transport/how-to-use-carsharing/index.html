In this case, they only pay for towing, a fine for parking and, if necessary, the storage of cars in a impoundment lot.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If the car was not impounded in your presence, you will be contacted (by phone, SMS, email or in the app) by representatives of the carsharing company and will tell you what options you have.
